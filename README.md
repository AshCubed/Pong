### Art
Only external art assets that were used were asteroids from [Game Code School](http://gamecodeschool.com/unity/building-asteroids-arcade-game-in-unity/).

### Fonts
[Bitfonts](https://www.mattlag.com/bitfonts/) 5x3, 5x5, and 9x9 fonts were used in my game.

### Code
No external code was used for mechanics, a package was used for correcting a problem with Unity's new input system where it will not set the same input device to two players - Keyboard for player 1 (WASD) and player 2 (Arrow Keys).
